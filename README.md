## Overview
_This is a more detailed description of Project Title. Go further here in explaining the purpose and process behind the creation of this project. Discuss the programs, APIs, libraries, and data sets used. Describe the structure of the data sets as well. With that context, go into the broader 'why' of the project. Then finally explain the project's current status and maintenance._

## Requirements
_List all programs, APIs, and non-csv files used in this project._

This code depends on the following libraries:
1. `pandas`
2. `numpy`
3. `matplotlib.pyplot`
4. `seaborn`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the data set from it's source has been downloaded, extracted, and saved as `name_of_data_file.csv`.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for this project. _Note that this template badge links to the Google homepage._

## Features
_Here is where a more comprehensive summary of the findings of the project go. First reiterate 'what' the project does, then go into detail about 'how' it does that._
```
include code samples when relevant
```

_Finally, complete this section with another, more contextualized explanation of the broader 'why' of the project, as well as limitations and further possibilities for it._

## Issues
- set ratings to a categorical variable, or set the half number to .5s for ease of calculations
- use the wikipedia api to get genre information for each artist
- find the most listened to genres
- find the average rating per genre
- find the distribution of ratings per genre
- find the overall distribution of ratings
- potentially also get release year informaiton from the wikipedia api
- make lists of repeat albums and figure out whether to use the more recent rating or the highest rating
- find the number of unique albums listened to this year
- for artists where i've listened to a high number of albums, find the distribution of ratings
- try to pull release date info from wiki api
